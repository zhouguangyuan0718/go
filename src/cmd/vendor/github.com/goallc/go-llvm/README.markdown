# Go bindings to system LLVM

This library provides bindings to a system-installed LLVM.

Currently supported:

  * LLVM 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15 and 14 from [apt.llvm.org](http://apt.llvm.org/) on Debian/Ubuntu.
  * LLVM 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15 and 14 from Homebrew on macOS.
  * Any of the above versions with a manually built LLVM through the `byollvm` build tag. You need to set up `CFLAGS`/`LDFLAGS` etc yourself in this case.

LLVM 23 is selected by default. You can select another LLVM version using a
build tag, for example `-tags=llvm17` to use LLVM 17. When using a manually
built LLVM 22 or newer, combine the version and custom-build tags, for example
`-tags="byollvm llvm23"`.

The GoALLC in-tree static LLVM payload is selected explicitly with
`-tags=staticllvm`. Add a version tag when the payload is not LLVM 23, for
example `-tags="staticllvm llvm20"`.

## Usage

If you have a supported LLVM installation, you should be able to do a simple `go get`:

    go get tinygo.org/x/go-llvm

You can use build tags to select a LLVM version. For example, use `-tags=llvm15` to select LLVM 15. Setting a build tag for a LLVM version that is not supported will be ignored.

## License

These LLVM bindings for Go originally come from LLVM, but they have since been [removed](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-remove-the-go-bindings/65725). Still, they remain under the same license as they were originally, which is the [Apache License 2.0 (with LLVM exceptions)](http://releases.llvm.org/9.0.0/LICENSE.TXT). Check upstream LLVM for detailed copyright information.

This README, the backports\* files, and the Makefile are separate from LLVM but are licensed under the same license.
