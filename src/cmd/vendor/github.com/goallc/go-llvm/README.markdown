# Go bindings for GoALLC LLVM

This repository contains the LLVM Go bindings used by GoALLC. It intentionally
targets the customized LLVM build maintained by the GoALLC project; a
system-installed LLVM is not supported.

## LLVM payload

The binding always reads LLVM headers below `${SRCDIR}/llvm`; dynamic linking
also reads the LLVM shared library there:

    llvm/include/llvm-c
    llvm/lib

`llvm` is not committed. The caller must create it as a symlink to an LLVM
payload with this layout. GoALLC's `cmd/dist` manages that symlink from its
`-llvm-dir` option, whose default is `$GOROOT/llvm`.

## Build tags

The LLVM API version and link mode are independent, mandatory build-tag axes:

* `llvm23` selects the LLVM 23 API. A future LLVM 24 port will add `llvm24`
  without changing how the payload path or link mode is selected.
* `dynamicllvm` links `llvm/lib/libLLVM`; it is the GoALLC default.
* `staticllvm` links `${SRCDIR}/libLLVMGoALLC.a`. GoALLC's `cmd/dist`
  assembles and caches this build artifact from the selected payload's normal
  LLVM component archives with `llvm-config` and `llvm-ar`.

For example:

    go test -tags='llvm23 dynamicllvm' ./...
    go test -tags='llvm23 staticllvm' ./...

The static command requires `libLLVMGoALLC.a` to have been assembled first.
The GoALLC toolchain does this automatically for `-llvm-link=static`.
The final link also consumes the system libraries reported by the selected
LLVM build. On Darwin, zstd is resolved with `pkg-config libzstd`; the
development package must be installed and discoverable through pkg-config.

Do not select multiple version tags or multiple link-mode tags in one build.

## Continuous integration

Automatic pull-request checks currently validate the binding source only. Full
dynamic and static tests require the customized GoALLC LLVM payload and are
validated as part of integration work. Once the project publishes prebuilt LLVM
payloads, CI will download those artifacts and run both link modes without
rebuilding LLVM from source.
